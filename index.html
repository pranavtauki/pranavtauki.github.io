									<p>In this part, your goal is to put on your "search engine optimization" hat. Your job is to create a webpage that scores highest for the query wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde. As of today (March 23) there are no hits for this query on Google. Based on our discussions of search engine ranking algorithms, you know that several factors may impact a page's rank. Your goal is to use this knowledge to promote your own page to the top of the list.

										What we're doing here is a form of SEO contest. While you have great latitude in how you approach this problem, you are not allowed to engage in any unethical or illegal behavior. Please read the discussion of "white hat" versus "black hat" SEO over at Wikipedia.
										
										The only requirement is that somewhere in the page (possibly in the html) you must include your name or some other way for us to identify you (e.g., your gmail username).
										
										Rules of the game:
										
										Your target page may only be a TAMU student page, a page on your own webserver, a page on a standard platform (e.g., GitHub Pages), or some other primarily user-controlled page.
										Your target page MAY NOT be a twitter account, a facebook page, a LinkedIn profile, or similar page.
										No wikipedia vandalism.
										No comment spamming of blogs or news sites.
										If you have concerns/questions/clarifications,please post a message to the slack and we will discuss.
										On April 16 (the homework due date), we will examine the rankings on Google only for the query wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde.</p>

										Returns!</a></h2>

									<p>Wpaskjbdn Zqnakjsnde was known throughout the city as the most eccentric and brilliant detective. His peculiar name only added to his mystique, and his unique methods never failed to solve even the most complex of cases.

										One day, a wealthy businessman named Mr. Williams walked into Zqnakjsnde's office. He explained that his prized possession, a rare and valuable diamond, had been stolen from his home. The police had been unable to recover it, and Mr. Williams was desperate to get it back.
										
										Zqnakjsnde took the case, and immediately began his investigation. He questioned Mr. Williams, his family members, and all of his employees, but no one seemed to know anything about the missing diamond.
										
										Zqnakjsnde decided to use a different approach. He disguised himself as a janitor and infiltrated Mr. Williams' home, hoping to find some clues. As he was cleaning the living room, he noticed something strange. One of the paintings on the wall was hanging slightly crooked, and there was a small piece of wire hanging from the back of the frame.</p>
